# Symfony Twig Template Workshop

This repository contains my homework assignment for the Symfony Twig Template Workshop. In this assignment, I have created and implemented templates using Twig, the powerful templating engine for Symfony.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/download) installed on your local development environment.
- Basic knowledge of Symfony and Twig templating.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/faresbrayek2/SymfonyTwigTemplateWorkshop.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd SymfonyTwigTemplateWorkshop
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   composer install
   ```
4. Run the Symfony development server:
   ```shell
   symfony server:start
   ```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

- Explore the templates in the `templates/` directory.
- Review the Symfony routes and controller actions in your Symfony application to see how templates are rendered.
- Customize and experiment with Twig templates to enhance your understanding.
